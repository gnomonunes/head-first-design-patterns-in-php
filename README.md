# Head First Design Patterns in PHP

This is a work-in-progress PHP version of the code examples from the book [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/), originally.

The book is based on Java, but I decided to implement the examples in PHP for study purposes.

The applications implemented on each chapter are pretty simple and doesn't have no real utility other than demonstrate the concepts addressed in the book.
